			“Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” Aldo Leopold, The Land Ethic, A Sand County Almanac.

By altering something or its environment, its original essence is lost. Bearing witness and existing alongside magic is the only way we can experience something in its truest form.</p>
